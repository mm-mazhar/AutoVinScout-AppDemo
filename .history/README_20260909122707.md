## What is Auto VIN Scout?

Auto VIN Scout is an AI-powered vehicle risk intelligence platform. It replaces expensive, static history reports (CARFAX, Experian) with **probabilistic risk modeling** — a multi-agent system that cross-references federal safety data, marketplace listing timelines, climate exposure, and real-world failure patterns to produce a single 0–100 risk score for any used vehicle.

The core insight: the most valuable vehicle data (DMV registrations, insurance claims) is locked behind federal laws and expensive paywalls. Auto VIN Scout sidesteps this by inferring risk from publicly available signals — marketplace behavior, FEMA disaster declarations, NHTSA recalls, auction forensics, and owner community sentiment — then synthesizes it into actionable intelligence with AI-generated negotiation scripts.

**Who it's for:**
- Individual buyers who want to know what's wrong before they drive 3 hours to see a car
- Flippers and brokers triaging dozens of listings per week
- Small used-car lots scoring inventory risk at scale
- Franchise dealers running predictive depreciation and title verification

1. **VIN Decode** — Decodes the 17-character VIN via NHTSA vPIC (free tier) or MarketCheck (paid tier) to extract make, model, year, engine code, drivetrain, and manufacturing plant.

2. **Durable Pipeline** — An Inngest function orchestrates the data collection steps with retry logic, concurrency limits (1 per org), and graceful degradation if any external API fails.

3. **Multi-Agent Risk Scoring** — Eight specialized AI agents each score a risk vector (0–100), then a Master LLM synthesizes the results into a human-readable executive summary and a seller negotiation script.

## Risk Vectors

Each report scores the vehicle across 8 independent risk dimensions. Mileage acts as the "Exposure Duration" multiplier across all factors.

| # | Vector | What It Detects | Weight |
|---|--------|-----------------|--------|
| 0 | **Baseline Health & Market Anomalies** | Odometer rollbacks, fire-sale pricing, mileage velocity, open recalls | 0.25 |
| 1 | **Safety Ratings & Crash Survivability** | NHTSA 5-star ratings, IIHS scores, ADAS features | 0.05 |
| 2 | **Geospatial Flood Forensics** | FEMA disaster overlap, listing-timeline intersection, submersion probability with Open Meteo | 0.15 |
| 3 | **Powertrain Complexity** | Engine architecture vs. mileage lifecycle ("The Hump" detection) | 0.10 |
| 4 | **Environmental Corrosion** | Salt Belt / Sun Belt / Coastal cumulative stress | 0.05 |
| 5 | **Theft & Vandalism Sentiment** | Model vulnerability + real-time regional OSINT from Reddit/Nextdoor | 0.05 |
| 6 | **Visual & Auction Forensics** | Salvage yard photos, Copart/IAAI watermarks, "Parts Only" listings | 0.20 |
| 7 | **Reliability & Social Proof** | Recurring mechanical failures from enthusiast communities, Mostly Reddit | 0.15 |

**Composite Score** = Σ (Score × Weight), capped at 100.

| Range | Label | Meaning |
|-------|-------|---------|
| 🟢 0–30 | Low | Standard wear. Mileage matches age. No disaster overlap. |
| 🟡 31–70 | Medium | High usage intensity. Noted concerns. Buyer caution advised. |
| 🔴 71–100 | High | Major red flag. Odometer discrepancy. Probable hidden damage. |

## Architecture

### Multi-Agent Risk Engine

The risk scoring system uses a **multi-agent architecture** where each agent is a stateless function that receives vehicle data and returns a scored vector:

```
RiskEngineOrchestrator.run(reportId)
  │
  ├── BaselineAgent       → Odometer anomalies, price volatility, recall severity
  ├── SafetyAgent         → NHTSA NCAP ratings, ADAS features, complaints/investigations
  ├── EngineAgent         → Powertrain complexity vs. mileage lifecycle ("The Hump" detection)
  ├── CorrosionAgent      → Salt Belt / Sun Belt / Coastal cumulative stress
  ├── FloodAgent          → FEMA disaster matching + Open-Meteo precipitation intersection
  ├── TheftAgent          → SERP-based regional theft OSINT (Bright Data SERP API)
  ├── ForensicsAgent      → Multimodal visual salvage detection + auction URL forensics (Bright Data SERP + LLM vision)
  ├── ValuationAgent      → (orchestrator method, not a standalone agent) → Real-time price prediction via Bright Data SERP + LLM
  ├── ReliabilityAgent    → Reddit failure sentiment (Bright Data, Reddit-Comments API)
  │
  └── Master LLM Synthesis
        ├── Executive Summary (plain-language risk explanation)
        └── Negotiation Script (seller-facing talking points)
```

Each agent produces a `RiskVectorResult` with a score (0–100), label, weight, narrative, and metadata. The orchestrator computes the weighted composite, then invokes a Master LLM (OpenRouter → Google GenAI fallback) to synthesize all narratives into a cohesive report.

If the LLM fails, a rules-based fallback generates the summary from agent findings — the report always completes.

### Visual & Auction Forensics Agent

The Forensics Agent detects **title washing** and unreported total-loss events by searching Google for the exact VIN and analyzing what comes back — both textually and visually.

**Flow:**

1. **SERP Fetch** — `SerpService.fetchVinSearch(vin)` queries Bright Data for the exact VIN (excluding social media noise). Returns organic URLs, text snippets, and up to 2 image/thumbnail URLs from the results.

2. **Heuristic Scoring** — A deterministic URL + text matrix runs first (no LLM cost):
   - *Severe URLs* (score 100): If any organic link contains a known salvage auction domain (copart.com, iaai.com, bidfax.info, bid.cars, etc.)
   - *Moderate Text* (score 55): If snippets contain keywords like "salvage", "rebuilt", "as-is", "parts only", "mechanic special"
   - *Clean* (score 15): No matches

3. **Image Fetching** — Up to 2 image URLs are fetched in parallel with a strict 3-second timeout each, converted to base64. Dead links are silently skipped.

4. **Multimodal LLM Analysis** — The text prompt (URLs, snippets, heuristic score) plus any fetched images are sent to the LLM. Both the primary (OpenRouter/Gemini) and fallback (Google GenAI) providers receive images as inline data, enabling visual wreck detection (crushed panels, salvage yard backgrounds, auction watermarks).

5. **Fallback** — If all LLMs fail, a deterministic narrative is returned based on the heuristic tier. The pipeline never crashes.

**Caveat:** Image availability depends entirely on what Google returns in the SERP thumbnails for that VIN. Many results won't have images — in that case the agent operates text-only and still provides value from URL/snippet analysis.

### Inngest Pipeline

The analysis runs as a durable Inngest function (analyze-report) with checkpointed steps. Each agent gets its own Vercel invocation and timeout budget.

```
verify-vehicle → fetch-recalls → upsert-recalls → fetch-market-history
→ fetch-safety-ratings → load-agent-input → fetch-agent-deps
→ [agents in parallel] → persist-results → [synthesis + price-prediction in parallel] → finalize-report
```

1. `verify-vehicle` — Confirms the vehicle record exists (retries with exponential backoff for transaction isolation)
2. `fetch-recalls` — Pulls NHTSA recall data
3. `upsert-recalls` — Persists recalls to DB (skipped if none found)
4. `fetch-market-history` — Fetches MarketCheck listing history (graceful degradation — logs warning and continues with empty history on failure)
5. `fetch-safety-ratings` — Fetches NHTSA NCAP data
6. `load-agent-input` — Loads full AgentInput from DB (vehicle + recalls + listings + safety ratings persisted in prior steps)
7. `fetch-agent-deps` — Fetches external dependencies in parallel: Open-Meteo weather, SERP theft snippets, SERP VIN search
8. **Agents (parallel)** — All 8 agents execute concurrently as separate steps: `agent-baseline`, `agent-safety`, `agent-engine`, `agent-corrosion`, `agent-flood`, `agent-theft`, `agent-forensics`, `agent-reliability`
9. `persist-results` — Writes all RiskVectorResults to DB
10. **Synthesis + Valuation (parallel)** — `master-synthesis` (weighted composite + Master LLM) and `price-prediction` (SERP + LLM formatting) run concurrently
11. `finalize-report` — Updates the Report record with final score, label, narratives, and price prediction; sets status to `COMPLETED`

Concurrency is limited to 1 per organization (`concurrency: { limit: 1, key: 'event.data.orgId' }`) to prevent credit race conditions. Retries are set to 0 — each agent handles primary → fallback LLM internally.

### Multi-Tenancy

- **User** → identified by Supabase Auth UUID
- **Organization** → owns billing (Stripe customer), credits, projects, and reports
- **OrganizationMember** → junction with role (OWNER / ADMIN / MEMBER)
- **Project** → logical grouping of reports within an org
- **Report** → one VIN analysis, linked to a Vehicle record

Row Level Security (RLS) policies enforce tenant isolation at the database level.

### RBAC

| Role | Capabilities |
|------|-------------|
| **OWNER** | Full control. Delete org, transfer ownership, manage billing. |
| **ADMIN** | Manage members, create/delete projects, invite users. |
| **MEMBER** | Create reports, view project data. Cannot manage org settings. |

Enforced server-side via `requireOrgRole()` guards and client-side via `can(role, action)` permission checks.

### Super Admin Dashboard

A separate, email-gated admin area (`/admin`) provides system-wide operational visibility — completely isolated from tenant dashboards.

<p align="center">
  <img src="public/HeroDark-04.png" alt="Super Admin Dashboard — System Analytics" width="100%" />
</p>

Access is controlled via the `SUPER_ADMIN_EMAILS` environment variable. Non-admin users are redirected to `/dashboard`.

**Capabilities:**
- **Overview cards** — Total users, organizations, active subscriptions, MRR at a glance
- **Revenue analytics** — Aggregated monthly recurring revenue, breakdown by plan tier, growth trends
- **User analytics** — Signup velocity, retention curves, active user counts over time
- **System status** — Database connectivity, latency monitoring, health checks
- **Entity management** — Browse all users, organizations, and subscriptions across the platform
- **CSV export** — Download snapshots of system-wide statistics for offline analysis

This is designed for operators who need to monitor the business without touching tenant data directly.
